Change LIDAR hillshading setting in TOC.
Other Tools: 
  - copy LIDAR selected in TIL to destination directory
  - create Tile Index Layer from directory (with subdirectory) and populate valid field path (very fast: use OSGeo4W shell with gdaltileindex command)
  - create virtual raster file from LIDAR active in TOC
  - check path field in Tile Index Layer to control valid path for raster
  - interactive help string and log message

##  Tile Index Layer Setting <a name="til_setting"></a>

Lidar Manager reads layers in Table of Content (TOC) and gets **only** polygon vector layer to populate "**Tile Index Layer LIDAR**" combo box list. Gets the first one in TOC. The list is empty if there aren't polygon layer. 

With dedicate button ![alt text](./readme_image/fig2.JPG) you can get the active polygon layer in TOC.

Choose your the TIL with LIDAR reference if exist, if not you can create it with dedicate tool "**Create TIL from DIR**" in the **Utility** section

In "**Field path file**" combo box are listing all the string type field present in the TIL, choose one with a file valid path (NB: it work with all file type). 

With dedicate button ![alt text](./readme_image/fig5.JPG) you can check path validity and report it in log box:

You can set the EPSG code for CRS from a dedicate field ("**Field EPSG Code**" combo box) or from Qgis combo box for EPSG code list ("**Qgis Epsg code"**).

Whenever you load or open Lidar Manager by default it gets EPSG code from current Qgis project.

NB: EPSG setting is used by TIL and VRT tools. Remember it.

With "**lock as default**" checkbox user can lock input variable in "**Tile Index Setting"**  to preserve change.
